# SokobanRS

An implementation of the game Sokoban written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the libraries [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) and [legion](https://github.com/amethyst/legion).

This project is based on this [tutorial](https://sokoban.iolivia.me), which used [specs](https://github.com/amethyst/specs)as its ECS library.
